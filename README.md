# TimeSeriesDataCapture
This is the parent project for a suite of applications which take time series data from an instrument, store as tagged, searchable, indexed files, and display on a publicly accessible website.  
Here is the original [briefing note](https://github.com/CMDT/TimeSeriesDataCapture/blob/master/Documents/inital/proposal/DigitalLabs-Marloes_Peeters_Research_Group-12_Week_Student_Project.pdf)

This is the AliceLiveProjects fork of the application. You can find credentials in the Alice Repo [here](https://github.com/CMDT/DigitalLabs_TeachingProjects/blob/master/docs/accounts/alice/accounts.md) (private)

# Setup

## MongoDB Hosting
The MongoDB database will store the runs, authentication, algorithms palettes and tags. To host the database a combination of Heroku and mLab will be used.

### Prerequisites

#### Heroku Account 
To host the database first a Heroku account is needed, sign up to [Heroku](https://signup.heroku.com)

### Hosting
From the [Heroku dashboard](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps) create a new application, name the app, and choose the appropriate region.

To install mLab MongoDb navigate to [mongolab addons page](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/mongolab) and install, ensuring the add-on is added to the newly created app

Within the Resources tab for the newely created application if you see the mLab MongoDB add-on mLab  has been succesfully installed.

### MongoDB user
Within the Resources tab for the database application click the mLab MongoDB add-on to navigate to the mLab dashboard.

Under the users tab add a new database user, you will need the database-username and database-password to connect.

## MongoDB Creation
To create the mongoDB database the mongo shell will be used.

### Prerequisites

#### MongoDB Shell
Before creating the MongoDB database, first MongoDB must be installed locally. Install [MongoDB Community Edition](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/#tutorial-installation) for the appropriate OS.

To start the mongo shell change directory to the `<mongodb installation dir>`

```
cd <mongodb installation dir>
```

Type `./bin/mongo` to start mongo. To ensure mongodb installation:

```
mongo --version
```

alternatively add `<mongodb installation dir>/bin` to the `PATH` environment variable.

### Creation
Connect to the mongodb server, mLab dashboard provides instruction on how to.

```
mongo <mongo server URI> -u <dbuser> -p <dbpassword>
```

Verify the database, the output should be the `<database name>`

```
db
```

To create the starting database template:

```
db.createCollection("runsCollection",{capped:false}); db.createCollection("tagsCollection",{capped:false});db.createCollection("algorithmsCollection",{capped:false}); db.createCollection("authenticationCollection",{capped:false}); db.createCollection("palettesCollection",{capped:false}); db.algorithmsCollection.insert({"name" : "default","parameters" : [ "T(Copper)", "T(Cell1)", "DAC"],"algorithm" : "return((T1-T2)/((DAC*DAC)/22))"}); db.palettesCollection.insert({"name" : "default","description" : "default colour palette","palette" : [ "#B2003F", "#00B20F","#FF005A"]});
```

*for more information of the starting database template see [mongodb-database-template.md](https://github.com/CMDT/TimeSeriesDataCapture/blob/master/Documents/mongodb-database-template.md)*

## OneDrive Application Setup
To setup OneDrive application

### Prerequisites
A OneDrive Developer account is needed

### Creating Application

1. Navigate to Microsoft Graph :  <https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/>
2. Click the My Apps login, located on the top bar when not signed in.
3. Microsoft will prompt for a login
4. Once logged in, click the Add An App button
5. Name the application and create


### Filling Application Details

Within a specific application : 

1. Take note of the Application Id (also known as Client Id)
2. Under Platforms click the Add Platform button
3. Choose the Web Option
4. Check the Allow Implicit Flow checkbox
5. Under Redirect URLs enter the applications callback, example [application_domain]/callback.html
6. Under Microsoft Graph Permissions , remove any default permissions
7. Add the Sites.Read.All Application Permission (not Delegated Permissions)

## Auth0
The single page web application (SPWA) uses Auth0 for authentication. 

### Prerequisites

#### Auth0 Account 
To use authentication first a Auth0 account is needed, sign up to [Auth0](https://auth0.com/signup)

### Setup 
The SPWA uses Auth0 *SINGLE PAGE APPLICATION* application type.

#### Create Single Page Application
On the Auth0 dashboard under the Applications section create a new application, picking the Single Page Web Applications application type.

Under settings for the newly created application add the domain of the SPWA within the Allowed Callbacks URLs, Allowed Web Origins and Allowed Origins text areas.


*If the domain of the application is not known the text areas can be filled later*

*Under Advanced Setting, under Endpoints take note of the OAuth Endpoints, these will be used for the Browse API*

#### Create Machine To Machine API
On the Auth0 dashboard under the API section create a new API.

*Take note of the API Audience*

## Dataformats
When importing runs from the OneDrive into the database the runs must be in an exact format.

### Folder Structure

```
<date-time>/
-----------T-Data/
-----------------data.txt
-----------Remarks/
-------------------Remark01.txt
```

### Formats
- run folder name must be the date and time delimited by a '-' format: yyyymmdd-hhmmss.
- Temperature_Log must be a csv file dimilited by a space, with a minimum of two columns. Line 1 must be column names, line 2 must be column units
- Remarks must be a txt file. Line 1 must be **Remark added after < seconds > seconds** where < seconds > is the remarks position. Line 2 must be the remark discription.

*see [example](https://github.com/CMDT/TimeSeriesDataCapture/tree/master/Documents/example%20data) dataformat*

## How to Use
The single page web application (SPWA) has two user types casual and admin both, below describes each use case.

## Casual user
The casual user is user who is not logged in thus admin controls are disabled. 
 
### Prerequisites
- none

### Features
- public runs are only visible
- searching runs
- viewing & sharing runs
- exporting runs

### Uses
#### Searching
To search for a run: on the home page of the SPWA the user can search by tags/time/date within the seach bar. When searching by tags a auto-complete will show.   


#### Viewing
Once a run has been searched for, a single run can be viewed simply by clicking on it, to view multiple runs use the checkboxes and blue View button.

One the view page the graph can be zoomed in and out using the mouse wheel and panned using click and drag. To offset the active drag click and drag while holding shift.

Underneath the graph is the Column-Tag panel, from here run tags can be viewed and columns visibility can be toggled. To switch the active graph simply click on a visible column.

To lock an axis, when panning or offsetting, the lock buttons located at the end of each axis can be toggled.

To view an annotation description click on an annotation label

#### Exporting 
Once a run has been searched for, runs can be zipped and saved to the users local machine by using the checkboxes to select multiple runs and clicking the green Export button.

## Admin User
The admin user is a user who is logged in thus admin controls are enabled. The admin users features and uses are a superset of the casual user features and uses.

### Prerequisites
- A OneDrive account is needed to import runs into the database, sign up to [OneDrive](https://login.microsoftonline.com)
- Logged into the SPWA

### Features
- private runs are visible
- deleting runs
- modifying runs
- importing runs

### Uses
#### Deleting
Once a run has been searched for, runs can be deleted from the database (runs cannot be deleted from OneDrive) by using the checkboxes to select multiple runs and clicking the red Delete button.

#### Modifying Annotations
On the view page, to add a new annotation click the '+' button. 

To change the annotation position click the down-wards arrow button on the annotation panel. Using the black downward arrow click and hold to reposition. To confirm the new position click the black square.

To edit the annotation description click the pencil icon on the annotation panel.

#### Modifying Tags
One the Column Tag panel switch to view tags. Click the pencil icon to edit the tags.

#### Importing Runs
To import runs from a OneDrive account, click the import button. If not already logged in click the login button to login into OneDrive. To preview a run click the graph preview button, to import runs select the checkboxes and click confirm.
