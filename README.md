# TimeSeriesDataCapture
This is the parent project for a suite of applications which take time series data from an instrument, store as tagged, searchable, indexed files, and display on a publicly accessible website.

# Accounts
This is a private repo, but may be public in the future.
All account details (usernames, passwords, private keys) are placed here during development, so that it's obvious when they are. If the code goes public, these account details are to be changed, and removed.
